A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and a destination server, primarily controlling access to resources and caching content.
 
To enable proxy functionality in Apache, use the following:

	# /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
	LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
	LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
 
## Forward Proxy
 
A [Forward Proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Forward_proxies) is typically used to:
 
- hide the identities of clients
- provide internet access to clients blocked by firewall
- cache content to reduce network traffic
 
A forward proxy accepts requests from internal clients and forwards them to an external resource.

To configure this in Apache, we can simply control who has access to external resources by
specifying their IP address.
 

	<VirtualHost *:80>
	  # Enables Apache to acting as forwarding server
	  ProxyRequests On
	 
	  # Adds Via header to requests
	  ProxyVia On
	  
	  <Proxy *>
	    Order deny,allow
	    Deny from all
	 
	    # Only allows this client to proxy requests
	    Allow from 192.168.0.11
	  </Proxy>
	</VirtualHost>


## Reverse Proxy
 
A [Reverse proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) is typically used to: 
 
- hide the identities of servers
- act as load balancer
- act as web accelerator
- used to perform A/B testing
 
A reverse proxy accepts requests from external clients and usually forwards them
to an internal resource.

To configure this in Apache, we use the `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` directives.

	<VirtualHost *:80>
	  # Prevents Apache from acting as forwarding server
	  ProxyRequests Off
	 
	  # http://example.com/assets/css to be internally converted into a proxy request to http://cdn.example.com/css
	  ProxyPass /assets/ http://cdn.example.com/
	  
	  # if http://cdn.example.com/css has a redirect to http://cdn.example.com/v2/css
	  # Apache will adjust the request to http://example.com/assets/v2/css before forwarding response
	  ProxyPassReverse /assets/ http://cdn.example.com/
	</VirtualHost>
